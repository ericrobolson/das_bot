Doing - 2
- [ ] Make lisp parser using bottom up + tdd, put on github
- [x] Add in location to everything
- [ ] Implement some tokenizer tests + cases now

* Add parsing of lists
* Add parsing of strings
* Add parsing of integers, maybe do numerical tower?
* Add parsing of floats, maybe do numerical tower?
* Add locations to errors
* Define methods


Todo 
* Execute methods
* Add ability to execute a command in a shell, such as launching a steam game 
* Add ability to play keyboard input
* Add ability to include or load other scripts
* Simplify execution of generator
* Do mouse movement
* Wire up `SendMessage`
* Abstract the two
* [This book on hacking](https://books.google.com/books?id=h4-7DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=games+with+apis+you+can+use+to+play+against+other+bots&source=bl&ots=12zOqoAKE_&sig=ACfU3U29YcWJcVgYSPVCxJ1fUMw-wTpHOg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG0ZO6ou70AhXiHTQIHcAzBwEQ6AF6BAgYEAM#v=onepage&q=games%20with%20apis%20you%20can%20use%20to%20play%20against%20other%20bots&f=false)
* Add ability to read memory and then do conditional things


Done
* Make generic keys based off of an enum
* Make a 'timeline' generator, which allows you to queue up key presses with a delay as well
* Wire up `SendInput` to send a single key
* Wire up Windows API
* Load program in interpreter
* Ensure that file types are a .bot file, or perhaps a .bot.lisp?
